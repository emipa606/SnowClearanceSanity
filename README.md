This mod means that your colonists will avoid an endless loop of constantly clearing snow when it is currently snowing. It also reduces the priority of clearing snow so that cleaning dirt is taken care of first.
	
If you need to, you can still order colonists to prioritise clearing snow.

[Version 1.0.1]
